# Meteor Underscore String

The [underscore.string](http://epeli.github.io/underscore.string/) string manipulation library repackaged for Meteor.


## NOTE

The author of the original underscore-string Meteor port [has said](https://github.com/possibilities/meteor-underscore-string/issues/4#issuecomment-25482323) that he'd prefer not to update the original package on Atmosphere, so I'm pushing this version for 0.6.5+ compatibility.
